# React Input autocompletion
React Input Autocompletation is a little component where you can use independently, since long time ago i wanted to create and implement my own autocomplete input module and now i had the chance to do one for a dev task for Quandoo.

## Creation Steps

- Dev enviroment and tools prepare, using Webpack Legato (V4) ready for produce modern React apps

for this step i used my own boilerplate prepared for using the latest version of Webpack with React (and also Redux)
